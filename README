This is under development version 0.7

This package contains a library for the robust approach to statistics. It is based on Weighted Likelihood approach.

On the actual version 0.7 (see STATUS file) the package contains function for robust estimation of normal location and scale in univariate and multivariate model, shape and scale in gamma model, p in binomial model, lambda in poisson model, linear regression and one step estimation, robust model selection criterion based on Mallows Cp, AIC, Cross-validation, Stepwise, Backward and Forward, t-test and variance test. There is also experimental code for univariate normal mixture models and for seasonal autoregressive models.

I have installed and run successfully the package under this system:

Fortran compiler: GNU project Fortran Compiler (v0.5.24)
C compiler: GNU project C and C++ Compiler (gcc-2.95)

To install the package, use the command R CMD INSTALL wle.

Not all the code is written by me. Please, see the CREDITS, the COPYING and the COPYRIGHT file for License of this code.
