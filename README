This is under development version 0.7

This package contains a library for the robust approach to statistics. It is based on Weighted Likelihood approach.

On the actual version 0.7-2 (see STATUS file) the package contains function for robust estimation of normal location and scale in univariate and multivariate model, shape and scale in gamma model, p in binomial model, lambda in poisson model, linear regression and one step estimation, robust model selection criterion based on Mallows Cp, AIC, Cross-validation, Stepwise, Backward and Forward, t-test and variance test. There is also experimental code for univariate normal mixture models, seasonal autoregressive models and for fractional models (only estimation of the fractional parameter).

I have installed and run successfully the package under this system:

Fortran compiler: GNU project Fortran Compiler (v0.5.24)
C compiler: GNU project C and C++ Compiler (gcc-2.96)
