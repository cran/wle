Library wle
===========

Version 0.7-6, 2003/10/28
Fix a problem in print method for functions wle.lm, wle.cp, wle.aic, wle.stepwise, wle.cv, mle.cp, mle.aic, mle.stepwise and wle.cv. Add functions wle.vonmises and wle.wrappednormal. Fix a bug in summary.wle.cp, and summary.mle.cp. Fix a bug in plot.wle.cp and plot.mle.cp 

Version 0.7-5, 2003/04/17
Fix a bug in wle.var.test. Small modification in mleaic.f code. Now plot.wle.lm as several new arguments: which, which.main, roots, col, ...

Version 0.7-4, 2003/03/04
Fix problems in wle.gamma, the function wle.riunif is removed, wle.ar and wle.fracdiff now use function sample instead of wle.riunif.

Version 0.7-3, 2002/06/24
Replace all the underscore (_) with <-.

Version 0.7-2, 2002/04/02
Fix the documentation (.Rd) file for *.summaries.Rd file. Include a preliminary version of the wle.fracdiff function with related functions. The R^2-adjusted is now evaluated according to the sum of the weights instead of the number of observations.

Version 0.7-1, 2002/03/25
Fix a bugs in wle.weights. Now it works also when location=FALSE
Fix the problems in print.summary.wle.lm.root with formatC

Version 0.7, 2002/01/02 
Fix the 56th observation in Hawkins, Bradu, Kass dataset. Fix a bugs in the wle.cv introduced in Version 0.6 and 0.6-1 of the package. Rewrite some parts of wleregfix subroutine (for wle.lm function and wle.aic, wle.cp, wle.cv and in some others functions). Delete all .Alias calls. Preliminary version of wle.ar.

Version 0.6-1, 2001/09/14
Bug fix in wle.lm and wle.var.test

Version 0.6, 2001/09/05
Most of the functions return the Pearson residuals, the smoothed model and the non parametric density estimator for each observation. I fix the definition of the SCHI2 Residual Adjustment Function. It is added a preliminary version of a function for the parameter estimation in a univariate normal mixture models.  

Version 0.5, 2001/05/20
Only minor changes, and minor bug fix.

Version 0.4, 2001/03/02

It is added the following functions: wle.binomial, wle.poisson, wle.gamma, wle.t.test and wle.var.test

Version 0.3, 2000/12/20

Now, all the functions (that needs it) use formula, summary and print functions are provided for about all functions. The R code is clean up and some bugs in the fortran code are fixed: one in wlestepwise.f and others in wleregfix.f, wlenorm.f and wlenormalmulti.f. The package use class.  

Version 0.2, 1999/12/25

It is added the following functions: wle.onestep, wle.cp, wle.aic, wle.cv, wle.stepwise, wle.normal.multi, plot.wle.lm, plot.wle.cp and some other functions for classical model selection such as mle.cp, mle.aic, mle.cv and plot.mle.cp. All the function related are documented and some examples and datasets are provided. The error report system from the fortran routine code is set up but not working yet.

Version 0.1, 1998/12/01

This is a small experimental library with only some functions, i.e., wle.normal, wle.smooth and wle.lm, not completly working. No documentation is provided.
